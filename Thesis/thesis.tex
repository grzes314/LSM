\author{Grzegorz Łoś}

\section{Introduction}
  This thesis presents a technique of pricing options known as Least Squares Monte Carlo or Longstaff-Schwartz model, due to it's discovers Francis Longstaff and Eduardo Schwartz. In the first two chapters some general facts from Stochastic Analysis, Monte Carlo theory and Black-Scholes model are reminded. Next chapters describe LSM algorithm, the implementation, examples of usege for valuation of exotic options.
